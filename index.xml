      <description>2017 is definitely a year of growth, very very painful but survived it. I’m so excited for this new year so many possibilities so many changes. Wishing everyone a better year than the last.</description>

      <description>I record the world, summarize learning, criticize and introspect myself here.
I’m open for the new job, so if you’re interesting company/team, have challenging problems to solve, use Go, open for remote (or you’re in Shenzhen) and hiring, let me know :)
